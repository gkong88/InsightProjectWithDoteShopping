        The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.[24]

        about POST:
        The POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.[23]

        about SEGMENT POST: A Webhook is an HTTP callback: a simple event-notification via HTTP POST. A web application implementing Webhooks will POST a message to a URL when certain things happen. The exact code required to make HTTP POST requests will depend on your applicationâ€™s software language and architecture.
